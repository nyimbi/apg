## APG Federated Learning Integration

### Model Architecture

The credit scoring system uses APG's federated learning framework to train and deploy machine learning models while preserving data privacy across tenants.

#### Federated Learning Benefits

**Privacy Preservation**:
- Customer data never leaves tenant boundaries
- Differential privacy with ε=1.0, δ=1e-5
- Secure aggregation of model updates
- Zero-knowledge proof validation

**Model Performance**:
- Continuous learning from all tenants
- Improved accuracy through diverse data
- Faster convergence with distributed training
- Robust models resistant to data bias

### Training Process

```python
# Example federated learning integration
from apg.federated_learning import FederatedLearningClient

class CreditScoringModelTrainer:
    async def train_model(self, tenant_data):
        # 1. Extract features locally
        features = await self.extract_features(tenant_data)
        
        # 2. Apply privacy preservation
        private_features = self.apply_differential_privacy(features)
        
        # 3. Send to federated learning
        fl_client = FederatedLearningClient(
            model_name="ar_credit_scoring_v2",
            tenant_id=self.tenant_id
        )
        
        # 4. Participate in federated training
        model_updates = await fl_client.train_local_model(private_features)
        
        # 5. Receive global model
        global_model = await fl_client.get_updated_model()
        
        return global_model
```

### Model Deployment

**Inference Pipeline**:
1. Feature extraction from customer data
2. Model inference through APG federated learning service
3. Post-processing and risk factor identification
4. Confidence scoring and manual review flagging
5. Audit logging and result storage

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Rating Scale

| Rating | Score Range | Default Risk | Description |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **AAA** | 750-850 | <2% | Exceptional creditworthiness |
| **AA** | 700-749 | 2-5% | Very strong credit profile |
| **A** | 650-699 | 5-10% | Strong credit, low risk |
| **BBB** | 600-649 | 10-15% | Good credit, moderate risk |
| **BB** | 550-599 | 15-25% | Fair credit, elevated risk |
| **B** | 500-549 | 25-35% | Poor credit, high risk |
| **CCC** | 450-499 | 35-50% | Very poor credit |
| **CC** | 400-449 | 50-70% | Extremely poor credit |
| **C** | 350-399 | 70-85% | Near default risk |
| **D** | 300-349 | >85% | Default imminent |

### Risk Factor Identification
