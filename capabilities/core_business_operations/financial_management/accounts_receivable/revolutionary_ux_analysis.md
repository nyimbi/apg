### The Practitioner Pain Points

After analyzing industry leaders like **Oracle NetSuite**, **SAP S/4HANA**, **Workday**, and **Zuora**, I've identified these critical pain points that even market leaders fail to solve elegantly:

1. **Context Switching Nightmare** - Users jump between 5+ screens for a single customer issue
2. **Reactive Exception Handling** - Systems tell you WHAT's wrong but not HOW to fix it
3. **Approval Workflow Black Holes** - No visibility into where approvals are stuck
4. **Vendor Communication Chaos** - Endless phone calls asking "where's my payment?"
5. **Manual Three-Way Matching Hell** - Hours spent on complex matching scenarios
6. **Month-End Crisis Mode** - Chaotic, stressful period-close processes
7. **Duplicate Payment Paranoia** - Fear of duplicate payments with inadequate prevention
8. **Cash Flow Guesswork** - Poor visibility into future cash positions
9. **Compliance Anxiety** - Constant worry about audit findings and violations
10. **Interface Complexity** - Complex workflows requiring extensive training
