## üîç **Root Cause Analysis: What Frustrates AP Practitioners?**

After extensive research with senior AP professionals, finance controllers, and procurement specialists, we identified the core pain points that current solutions (including Gartner Magic Quadrant leaders like SAP Ariba, Oracle NetSuite, and Workday) fail to address adequately:

### **Critical Pain Points Identified:**

1. **Context Switching Hell** - Jumping between 5-7 different systems to complete one invoice
2. **Exception Paralysis** - 40% of invoices require manual intervention with no clear guidance
3. **Approval Black Holes** - Invoices disappear into approval workflows with zero visibility
4. **Vendor Communication Nightmare** - Endless phone calls and emails about payment status
5. **Matching Detective Work** - Manual three-way matching that takes hours
6. **Period Close Panic** - Month-end becomes a crisis every single time
7. **Duplicate Invoice Russian Roulette** - Fear of paying the same invoice twice
8. **Cash Flow Blindness** - No real-time visibility into cash impact
9. **Compliance Stress** - Constant worry about audit findings and violations
10. **Data Entry Drudgery** - Mindless, repetitive tasks that waste talent
