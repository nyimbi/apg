### Additional APIs
Similar REST API patterns are implemented for all sub-capabilities with comprehensive CRUD operations, business logic endpoints, and reporting APIs.

## Configuration

### Order Workflows
```python
# Example workflow configuration
workflow_steps = [
    {
        'task_type': 'PICK',
        'task_name': 'Pick Items',
        'estimated_duration': 30,
        'quality_check_required': True
    },
    {
        'task_type': 'PACK', 
        'task_name': 'Pack Order',
        'estimated_duration': 15,
        'depends_on': ['PICK']
    },
    {
        'task_type': 'SHIP',
        'task_name': 'Ship Order', 
        'estimated_duration': 10,
        'depends_on': ['PACK']
    }
]
```

### Pricing Strategies
```python
# Example pricing strategy
strategy = {
    'pricing_method': 'COST_PLUS',
    'markup_percentage': 40.0,
    'minimum_margin': 25.0,
    'dynamic_factors': {
        'inventory_level': 0.1,
        'demand_factor': 0.15,
        'competitor_pricing': 0.2
    }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Sales Order
```python
from sales_order_management.order_entry.service import OrderEntryService

service = OrderEntryService(db_session)

order_data = {
    'customer_id': 'customer-123',
    'order_date': '2024-01-15',
    'lines': [
        {
            'item_code': 'WIDGET-001',
            'quantity_ordered': 10,
            'unit_price': 25.00
        }
    ]
}

order = service.create_sales_order('tenant-1', order_data, 'user-123')
result = service.submit_order('tenant-1', order.order_id, 'user-123')
```

### Converting Quote to Order
```python
from sales_order_management.quotations.service import QuotationsService

service = QuotationsService(db_session)
result = service.convert_to_order('tenant-1', 'quote-456', 'user-123')

if result['success']:
    order_data = result['order_data']
    # Create order using order entry service
```

## Performance Considerations
