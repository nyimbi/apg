## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Low Verification Accuracy

**Symptoms**: Verification confidence scores below 80%

**Solutions**:
1. Check biometric data quality
2. Verify lighting conditions for face/iris
3. Ensure proper finger placement for fingerprints
4. Re-enroll templates if needed

```python
# Check data quality
quality_assessment = await biometric_service.assess_quality(
    biometric_data=image_data,
    modality="face"
)

if quality_assessment['score'] < 0.7:
    # Provide quality improvement suggestions
    improvements = quality_assessment['improvement_suggestions']
```

#### Slow Verification Times

**Symptoms**: Verification taking >1 second

**Solutions**:
1. Optimize image resolution
2. Check network connectivity
3. Monitor system resources
4. Enable caching for frequent users

```python
# Performance monitoring
performance_metrics = await biometric_service.get_performance_metrics()
bottlenecks = performance_metrics['bottlenecks']
```

#### High False Positive Rates

**Symptoms**: Incorrect identity matches

**Solutions**:
1. Increase verification threshold
2. Enable multi-factor authentication
3. Use behavioral biometrics
4. Implement liveness detection

```python
# Adjust verification threshold
await biometric_service.update_verification_settings(
    modality="face",
    threshold=0.9,  # Increase from default 0.8
    enable_liveness=True
)
```

### System Health Monitoring

Monitor system health and performance:

```python
# Health check
health_status = await biometric_service.get_health_status()

# Performance metrics
metrics = await biometric_service.get_performance_metrics()

# System diagnostics
diagnostics = await biometric_service.run_diagnostics()
```
