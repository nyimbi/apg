## ðŸš€ Next Steps

This todo.md file serves as the **DEFINITIVE DEVELOPMENT PLAN** for the Audio Processing capability. Each phase must be completed in order with all acceptance criteria met before proceeding to the next phase.

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Follow CLAUDE.md standards exactly** (async, tabs, modern typing)
2. **Integrate with all mandatory APG capabilities** (auth_rbac, ai_orchestration, etc.)
3. **Achieve performance targets** (98%+ accuracy, <200ms latency)
4. **Maintain >95% test coverage** with comprehensive validation
5. **Create complete APG-aware documentation** with capability cross-references

**Use TodoWrite tool throughout development to track progress and mark tasks as completed.**
