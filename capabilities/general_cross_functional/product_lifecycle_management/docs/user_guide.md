**Q: How does multi-tenant isolation work for products?**
A: Each APG tenant has completely isolated product data. Product numbers can be duplicated across tenants without conflict, and users only see products within their assigned tenant(s).

**Q: What is the maximum number of products supported?**
A: PLM is designed to scale to enterprise levels with no hard limits on product count. Performance is optimized for tens of thousands of products with proper database indexing and caching.

### Engineering Change Questions

**Q: Who can approve engineering changes?**
A: Change approvals are controlled by APG Auth & RBAC permissions. Typically, technical leads, engineering managers, quality managers, and other stakeholders are assigned approval rights based on change type and impact.

**Q: Can changes be implemented without approval?**
A: No, PLM enforces approval workflows for all changes except draft modifications. Emergency procedures may allow expedited approvals but require post-implementation validation.

**Q: How are change impacts calculated?**
A: Change impacts are calculated using configurable cost models, BOM analysis, manufacturing complexity assessments, and historical data. AI-powered impact analysis provides additional insights for complex changes.

**Q: Can I track change implementation progress?**
A: Yes, PLM provides detailed implementation tracking with milestone management, resource allocation monitoring, and progress reporting with integration to project management tools.

### Collaboration Questions

**Q: How many people can participate in a collaboration session?**
A: Standard sessions support up to 50 participants with excellent performance. Enterprise configurations can support up to 100 participants depending on network infrastructure and feature usage.

**Q: Are collaboration sessions recorded?**
