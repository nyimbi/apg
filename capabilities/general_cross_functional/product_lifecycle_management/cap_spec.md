## Data Models Following APG's Coding Standards (CLAUDE.md)

### Core Data Models

**Following APG Standards:**
- Async Python with proper async/await patterns
- Tabs for indentation (not spaces)
- Modern Python 3.12+ typing (`str | None`, `list[str]`, `dict[str, Any]`)
- `uuid7str` for all ID fields from `uuid_extensions`
- Multi-tenancy patterns with `tenant_id` isolation
- Pydantic v2 validation with `ConfigDict(extra='forbid')`
- Runtime assertions and `_log_` prefixed methods

```python
# Example PLM Model Following APG Standards
from uuid_extensions import uuid7str
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ConfigDict
from typing import Optional
import asyncio

class PLProduct(APGBaseModel):
	"""Product master data model following APG standards"""
	
	model_config = ConfigDict(
		extra='forbid',
		validate_by_name=True,
		validate_by_alias=True
	)
	
	# Standard APG fields
	product_id: str = Field(default_factory=uuid7str)
	tenant_id: str = Field(..., description="APG tenant isolation")
	created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
	updated_at: Optional[datetime] = None
	
	# PLM specific fields
	product_number: str = Field(..., max_length=50)
	product_name: str = Field(..., max_length=200) 
	product_type: ProductType = Field(...)
	lifecycle_phase: LifecyclePhase = Field(default=LifecyclePhase.CONCEPT)
	
	# APG integrations
	manufacturing_bom_id: Optional[str] = None
	digital_twin_id: Optional[str] = None
	financial_cost_center: Optional[str] = None
	
	async def _log_product_creation(self) -> None:
		"""APG standard logging method"""
		assert self.product_id is not None
		# Logging implementation
		
	async def sync_to_manufacturing(self) -> bool:

		try:
			# APG manufacturing integration
			manufacturing_service = await self.get_manufacturing_service()
			await manufacturing_service.sync_product_bom(product_id)
			
		except Exception as e:
			await self._log_error(f"BOM sync failed: {e}")
			raise
	
	async def process_digital_twin_creation(self, product_id: str) -> None:
		"""Async digital twin creation"""
		assert product_id is not None
		
		try:
			# APG digital twin integration
			twin_service = await self.get_digital_twin_service()
			await twin_service.create_product_twin(product_id)
