- **Non-Repudiation**: Cryptographic proof of actions and transactions
- **Cross-Chain Support**: Multi-blockchain compatibility and interoperability

### 2. Decentralized Identity & Authentication
- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: User-controlled identity management
- **Verifiable Credentials**: Cryptographically verifiable identity proofs
- **Multi-Signature Authentication**: Distributed authentication mechanisms
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Privacy-preserving identity verification
- **Decentralized PKI**: Distributed public key infrastructure
- **Identity Recovery**: Secure identity recovery mechanisms

### 3. Smart Contract Security
- **Access Control Contracts**: Programmable permission systems
- **Automated Compliance**: Smart contract-based regulatory compliance
- **Multi-Party Agreements**: Automated contract execution
- **Escrow Services**: Trustless escrow and payment systems
- **Audit Automation**: Automated security auditing and monitoring
