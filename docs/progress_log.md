# APG Goal Progress Log

This log tracks progress toward the active APG objective:

> Systematically and comprehensively close the gap between aspiration/intent and executable reality. Fully achieve the goals and aims of APG. Tidy up documentation and tests in the root directory by putting them in the correct place.

Use this file for durable progress, verification evidence, known gaps, and the next concrete cleanup or implementation slice.

## Current Rules

- Keep commits small enough to verify and review.
- Do not stage unrelated dirty worktree changes.
- Treat the current filesystem and command output as authoritative.
- Record evidence before claiming completion.
- Keep root-level documentation and tests moving toward canonical locations under `docs/` and `tests/`.

## Progress Entries

### 2026-05-26 01:35 EAT

Completed and pushed:

- Recreated `.venv` with `uv`, installed editable APG with dev and language-server extras, and verified the Python/CLI entry points.
- Added first-class AI agent composition support and pushed commit `e2cdade` (`Make AI agents executable composition units`) to `origin/main`.
- Added `docs/ai_agent_composition.md` and focused tests in `tests/test_ai_agent_composition.py`.
- Verified the AI-agent slice with:
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_ai_agent_composition.py -q`
  - `py_compile` for changed compiler/composition modules
  - generated `ai_agents.py` compile/exec smoke
  - `apg`, `apg-compile`, and `apg-language-server` help smoke

Current cleanup findings:

- The root still contains report/summary documentation that should be routed under `docs/reports/` or `docs/archive/`.
- The root has 45 deleted `test_*.py` paths with matching untracked files under `tests/`; a checksum pass found no content differences for that move set.
- The worktree also contains many unrelated capability changes under `capabilities/`; those must stay isolated from root docs/tests cleanup commits unless explicitly verified as part of a capability slice.

Next concrete slice:

- Stage the verified root `test_*.py` to `tests/` moves.
- Move root reports and duplicate README variants into appropriate `docs/` subdirectories with an index.
- Run targeted pytest collection/import checks for moved tests.
- Commit and push the cleanup slice if verification is adequate.

### 2026-05-26 01:38 EAT

Completed checkpoint:

- Reverified the 45 root `test_*.py` moves against their `tests/` copies with SHA-256 checksums; no differences were reported.
- Moved root implementation reports into `docs/reports/`.
- Moved duplicate root README variants and planning/reference documents into `docs/archive/`.
- Added indexes for the reports and archive directories, and linked them from `docs/README.md`.

Verification still required before commit:

- Stage only the root docs/tests cleanup paths.
- Check that no moved root test content changed during routing.
- Run pytest collection on the moved root tests, or record any collection blockers precisely.

Verification result:

- `git diff --cached --check` passed.
- Pytest collection command found 104 tests under the moved `tests/test_*.py` paths, then stopped with 11 collection errors.
- Collection blockers were missing runtime dependencies or modules: `uuid_extensions`, `numpy`, `agents`, and `capabilities.edge_computing`.
- These blockers are recorded as executable-reality gaps for follow-up capability/dependency work; the file moves themselves are staged as `R100` renames.
- `docs/README.md`, `docs/reports/README.md`, and `docs/archive/README.md` local links were checked; all linked files exist after tightening the docs index to current files.

### 2026-05-26 01:45 EAT

Completed and pushed:

- Committed and pushed the verified root docs/tests cleanup slice as `0ae9214` (`Move root docs and tests into canonical directories`).
- Root `test_*.py` files now live under `tests/`.
- Root reports, duplicate README variants, and reference notes now live under `docs/reports/` or `docs/archive/`.

Next concrete slice:

- Resolve the moved-test collection blockers by routing or implementing the missing runtime surfaces: `uuid_extensions`, `numpy`, `agents`, and `capabilities.edge_computing`.
- Audit the unrelated dirty capability worktree before staging any further capability changes.

### 2026-05-26 02:25 EAT

In progress:

- Added a provider-neutral AI agent integration layer under `agents.integrations`.
- Added built-in runtime adapter specs for `local`, `codex`, `claude_code`, `opencode`, and `pi`.
- Extended first-class APG `agent` declarations with terse `runtime:` / `runner:` syntax.
- Updated generated `ai_agents.py` manifests so agent specs carry `runtime`.
- Added tests for default adapter registration, CLI command construction, local backend execution, and APG runtime parsing/generation.
- Resolved the earlier moved-test import/runtime blockers for `uuid_extensions`, `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `fastapi`, `agents`, `capabilities.edge_computing`, `capabilities.computer_vision`, and `capabilities.iot_management`.
- Made root pytest async handling explicit with `pytest.ini`.
- Made `capabilities.common` imports tolerate unavailable optional subcapabilities instead of breaking unrelated capability imports.

Verification:

- `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile agents/integrations.py agents/base_agent.py agents/__init__.py compiler/ast_builder.py compiler/ai_agent_composition.py compiler/code_generator.py compiler/semantic_analyzer.py`

- `.venv/bin/python -m tests.test_learning_system`
- `.venv/bin/python -m tests.test_deployment_system`
- `.venv/bin/python -m tests.test_vision_iot_integration`

Current broader collection findings:

- `tests/` collection now reaches 191 tests before stopping on the next two blockers.
- Remaining collection blockers are `capabilities.common.agents` not existing and missing `Crypto` for `capabilities.common.conf.blockchain_audit`.

Next concrete slice:

- Add or route `capabilities.common.agents` to the executable agent runtime.
- Add the blockchain audit dependency or replace the Crypto dependency with stdlib-backed signing where appropriate.

### 2026-05-26 02:55 EAT

Completed checkpoint:

- Added `capabilities.common.agents` as a compatibility capability with managed agent models, an in-memory `AgentManagerService`, orchestration/decision/communication helpers, capability registry, learning/template engines, and test service doubles.
- Replaced the hard import requirement on `Crypto.*` in `capabilities.common.conf.blockchain_audit` with a stdlib HMAC-backed fallback while preserving pycryptodome when available.
- Fixed invalid `dataclasses.field(...)` usage in blockchain audit models that was uncovered after import collection reached the module.
- Preserved blockchain mining metrics with sufficient precision for fast local runs.

Verification:

- `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile capabilities/common/conf/blockchain_audit.py capabilities/common/agents/__init__.py capabilities/common/agents/models.py capabilities/common/agents/service.py capabilities/common/agents/orchestration_engine.py capabilities/common/agents/decision_engine.py capabilities/common/agents/communication_hub.py capabilities/common/agents/capability_framework.py capabilities/common/agents/learning_engine.py capabilities/common/agents/template_engine.py capabilities/common/agents/tests/test_utils.py`

- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_agent_basic.py tests/test_blockchain_audit.py` -> 10 passed
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest --collect-only -q tests` -> 204 collected
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests` -> 168 passed, 33 failed, 3 errors

Current broader execution findings:

- Root test collection is now clean.
- Remaining failure clusters are AI enum compatibility, composable template root resolution, integrated code-generation AST constructor compatibility, parser/AST-builder coverage, semantic analyzer coverage, and final-verification fixtures.

### 2026-05-26 03:20 EAT

Completed checkpoint:

- Restored AI model lifecycle compatibility by adding `AIModelState.CONFIGURED` and defaulting `AIModelConfiguration.state` to configured.
- Made legacy AST construction work with `module_name`, `workflows`, and positional `TypeAnnotation("str", False)` call shapes used by moved tests.
- Made the composable template engine resolve the canonical `templates/composable` root when callers pass a stale test-relative path.
- Added built-in capability metadata fallbacks for the composable engine so composition works even without generated capability template directories.
- Added shared pytest fixtures for migrated final-verification tests.
- Restored hybrid and legacy code-generation paths by adding legacy entity-file generation and string default handling.
- Added a source-backed parser compatibility path plus lightweight AST builder support for legacy APG syntax, including Unicode identifiers, DB blocks, workflows, agents, and semantic analyzer fixtures.
- Fixed `LoadBalancer.add_backend()` compatibility with backend dictionaries that use `id`.
