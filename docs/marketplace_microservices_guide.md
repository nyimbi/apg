    client: {
        permissions: ["create_projects", "browse_freelancers", "make_payments"];
        verification_required: {
            email: true;
            payment_method: true;
            identity: false;
        };
        commission_structure: {
            platform_fee: 0%;
            payment_processing_fee: 2.9%;
        };
        dashboard: {
            layout: "client_dashboard";
            widgets: ["active_projects", "freelancer_recommendations"];
        };
    };
    
    freelancer: {
        permissions: ["create_profile", "submit_proposals", "receive_payments"];
        verification_required: {
            identity: true;
            professional_credentials: true;
            background_check: "optional_premium";

deployment_pattern CanaryDeployment {
    stages: [
        {
            name: "initial_canary";
            traffic_percentage: 5%;
            duration: "10m";
            success_criteria: {
                error_rate: "<1%";
                latency_p99: "<500ms";
            };
        },
        {
            name: "expanded_canary";
            traffic_percentage: 25%;
            duration: "30m";
            success_criteria: {
                business_metrics: "stable";
            };
        }
    ];
    
    rollback_triggers: [
        {
            condition: "error_rate > 2%";
            action: "immediate_rollback";
        }
    ];
}
```

### 2. Blue-Green Deployments

Zero-downtime deployments with instant rollback:

```apg
deployment_pattern BlueGreenDeployment {
    environments: {
        blue: {status: "active", traffic: 100%};
        green: {status: "staging", traffic: 0%};
    };
    
    switch_criteria: {
        health_checks_pass: true;
        performance_tests_pass: true;
        smoke_tests_pass: true;
    };
